less than 2, 000 employees. i need to be in a role where both my accountingfinance and systems background are needed and has opportunity for growth. i am very good at working with typea personalities in both accounting and systems, because i know how to frame the questions. while my resume includes a number of environments and technologies such as oracle ebs, python and angular, do not assume that these are the only technologies i will work with or these are the only technologies i have used. i have experience with many other technologies, but i dont want to convey a greater sense of knowledge than i have achieved. finally, i left burns and mcdonnell due to the 2 hour round trip commute. while i may consider temporary positions with a 2 hour commute, i will not consider any positions with
